# Estimation approach

Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course

# Estimate by size

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------:|
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                       |       20 |
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC                                                            |      350 |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)                                                        |     7000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    |      700 |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     |    21000 |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |      4.5 |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|                                    | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| estimate by size                   | | |
| estimate by product decomposition  | | |
| estimate by activity decomposition | | |
